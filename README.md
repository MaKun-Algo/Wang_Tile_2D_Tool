# Wang_Tile_2D_Tool
A tool to demonstrate and utilize the Wang Tile Algorithm for creating 2D maps using various textures.

The Tool creates dynamic 2D Wang Tile images with dynamic adjustment of weights and valid edges/ neighbors. 
The output can be shown and is stored as a Text document in a usable format.
